VoteIT Live widget
==================

Displays status and latest entries from a meeting.
Requires the VoteIT version that depends on Arche.

Enable it via the 'Advanced'-tab when editing a meeting.
When enabled, it will expose a very simple view at <meeting>/live_widget and <agenda item>/live_widget
There's also a JSON version called 'live_widget.json', suitable for javascript queries.
